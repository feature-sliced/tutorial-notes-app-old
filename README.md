# Welcome to Feature-Sliced Design!

This repo is a starter for completing the tutorial. It's a regular Remix app, slightly tweaked for convenience.

To run the app, use the `dev` script:

```
pnpm dev
```

Other helpful scripts at your disposal:

```
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format
```

To see the solution, check out the `solution` branch.

To see the changes that have been made to the original Remix app, check out the [commit history](https://github.com/feature-sliced/tutorial-notes-app/commits).
